In this early MVP you can:

- Receive mouse and keyboard input.
- Draw paths, images and text using a 2D vector graphics API.
- Draw 2D/3D graphics using OpenGL ES 3.1 (minus a few features like mapped buffers)
- Build user interfaces using our UI API and default widgets.
- Read and write files using a capability-based API.
